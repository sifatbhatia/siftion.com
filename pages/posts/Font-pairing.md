# Font pairing: How to find the right combinations for your web designs


When working on a design project, there are a lot of things that need to be taken into account to accomplish a sense of completion.

The list of design elements includes color scheme, UI interactions, layout, illustration, and typography. However, font pairing is one aspect of web design that is frequently disregarded. A great design must have the right font combinations. But for most people, choosing great fonts can seem like an improbable dark art. (Aravani, A guide to font pairing for web designers: TIPS + 30 amazing examples! 2022)

It's one thing to select the appropriate typeface. Finding a typeface that will portray the required vibe is typically not too difficult once the brand's voice and style have been defined.

But when you may use two different fonts instead of one to reflect your brand and repeat itself throughout your website? A good and well-balanced font combination may keep visitors interested, build a hierarchy for your material, and reveal more about the character and approach of your business.

However, font pairing might be challenging. You will, after all, be adding yet another level of intricacy to the mix. But if done well, it may elevate your designs to a completely new plane.

Imagine matching fonts as finding the ideal match! There are several font options available, some of which are really attractive and well-made. When many of these are coupled, they may at first appear to work well, but as they are used, it may become apparent that they are not a good fit. For instance:

using two almost identical fonts could seem like a safe choice, the reader or user may find the end result tedious and monotonous.
employing two typefaces that are radically different from one another may confuse the consumer regarding the aesthetic of your company.
If both of your fonts are really ornate, bold, and dominant, your hierarchy will be completely messed up.

So, much as in relationships, it's not about selecting two fonts that are the same or opposed. It all comes down to balance and complementing one another. To be successful, the 'font pairing’ must function as a team to reflect your brand and generate a sense of harmony, fluidity, and, most crucially, coherence.

Tips to find the right font pair

There is no formula for choosing the correct font mix, and with thousands of free fonts available online, even experienced designers may find this a time-consuming effort. However, before we get into the font pairing examples, here are a number of things to keep in mind as a guide that will hopefully help you through the process.


1. Create the Desired Feeling

Choosing the appropriate fonts and styles can tell visitors a lot about your business. Both typefaces you choose should be consistent with your brand and aid in evoking the desired feeling in the audience. They can even affect a user's decisions while on the site if applied effectively.

Choose fonts that express your brand's attitude and purpose not only separately but also in combination. Serif fonts, for example, are considered more historic and serious. However, when coupled with a modern sans serif font, the entire effect can be quite fresh and appealing.




2. Delegate Roles

Each typeface you select will play a part on your website, and you will be in charge of the assigning process. The font that looks excellent on large headlines is unlikely to function well on small text. So, consider the 'roles' (typography styles) you will require (such as body text, caption text, huge headings, subheadings, and so on) and choose your fonts accordingly.
This quickly narrows your possibilities, because using a script font for both headings and significant blocks of text is obviously not a good idea. As a result, at least one of the typefaces you select should be readable in long paragraphs and legible in small sizes.

For large headlines, on the other hand, you can be more creative and choose a bold and unusual font.

3. Legibility and readability

Whatever font type, mood, or combo you select for your brand, having understandable and legible content on your website should serve as a general rule.

The arrangement of fonts and words to make written text flow in a straightforward, easy-to-read manner is known as readability. This is especially true for long blocks of text. Serif and Sans-serif fonts are unquestionably superior in this situation. Cursive and slab fonts, on the other hand, may be difficult to read. You can emphasize the elegance of your intended font a little more in headlines. However, readability always comes first in paragraphs with large blocks of material.

Legibility refers to how quickly letters may be distinguished from one another (for example, the letters 'I' and I This is important for both huge text and little text, such as headings. As a result, make sure the fonts you choose are easy to read and legible in all of the different sizes you'll be utilizing them in, as well as in all-caps if you intend to use any all-caps headings on your website.


4. Don't Be Afraid of the Classics

Because of how overused classic types like Helvetica and Baskerville are, many web designers (including me) are hesitant to utilize them. However, font selection and pairing aren't about how you feel about the typography on your website. It is about how the users feel and their reading experience. So there's no shame in going with a classic if it gets the job done!

Font Pairing Guidelines

Here are some simple yet crucial guidelines to follow when combining fonts:

Rule number one: Never use more than three fonts on your website.

You'll need a font for your headlines that looks well at larger sizes and captures the visitor's attention. You will also require a legible and readable font for your body text. Begin with these two and only add another if absolutely necessary.

Too many fonts can produce a jarring experience, confusing the user about the mood and style of your business, and making the result difficult to understand.

2. Use typeface combinations to create contrast — but not too much contrast.
Font pairs should be significantly different — for example, don't use a sans serif typeface in a header that looks suspiciously similar to a sans serif used in the body material. You want diverse typeface combinations that are visually different but still complement each other. (Kennedy)


What happens when we combine a typeface with calligraphic flourishes, such as Great Vibes, with a serif, such as Merriweather? As a result, we have an unappealing sensation of contrast. 


Great Vibes' flourishes and loops have a tenderness and refinement, whereas Merriweather is a no-nonsense design with a formality represented by its serif letterforms. The contrast is too stark in this case for the combination to work.

Let's try a different font combination. Vollkorn, a slightly whimsical serif typeface, is used in the header. We matched it with Open Sans, a more neutral and straightforward sans serif. This combination works nicely because, while there is contrast, the subtlety of both types makes them aesthetically complementary. (“A Non-Designer’s Guide to Pairing Fonts”)



3. Contrast font weights

Another technique to maintain a clear visual hierarchy is to employ varying font weights with distinct variances in font boldness. For example, try pairing Didot and Rockwell; you'll notice that they don't work well together because they both have a strong presence.

In the example above, the best combination is attained by combining the heavy Roboto Black with the light Roboto Light. The key to getting the proper level of contrast is to understand that fonts are similar to people: when you combine two with a lot of personality or presence, you get a discordant design. However, when an eye-catching one is combined with a neutral or lighter font, harmony is achieved.

4.  Mix distinct fonts with neutral types.

 If one of your fonts has a lot of personality and a very distinct style, don't combine it with another font that likewise draws a lot of attention to itself. It's ideal to mix a distinctive font with a more neutral one. (“A Non-Designer’s Guide to Pairing Fonts”)



In the preceding example, a script typeface, Blackjack, is blended with another script font, Milkshake, resulting in a rather jarring look. The sample on the right, on the other hand, uses the more neutral Montserrat Light, which makes the design much more pleasant and readable.

5.  Use fonts from the same typeface.

Remember that using multiple fonts from the same typeface might save you a lot of time while producing exactly the appearance you want. You could, for example, do well with a Helvetica Black header and a Helvetica regular body. 


Alternatively, as seen in the example above, you can mix Raleway Black Head with Raleway Thin. (Because they're from the same font family, they should get along!) (“A Non-Designer’s Guide to Pairing Fonts”)


# Typography is essential for web design

There are numerous factors to good web design. Consider font pairings with the same care as you would when selecting a color palette. The tone of the typefaces you choose, how you style them, and their legibility all contribute significantly to a user's experience with a web design. Find interesting fonts that speak to the personality of what you're creating and provide the finest potential experience for your visitors.
