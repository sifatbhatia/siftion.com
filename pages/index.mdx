# Sifat Bhatia

Hey, I'm a Full-stack developer. Currently, self-employed and looking for a position
Web Development/Designer or as a Full-stack Developer.

I have strong experience in Wireframing, Prototyping, UI/UX, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React as well as Content management systems like WordPress and Web builders like Squarespace, Wix, Shopify.

I enjoy working with NPM, React, Next.js and crafting beautiful front-end experiences as well as strong and stable back-end.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.

**New Site is in the works**
